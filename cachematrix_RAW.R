## This function calculates the inverse of a square matrix 
## created with the makeCacheMatrix.R function. However, it first
## checks to see if the matrx inverse has already been calculated.
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the inverse 
## matrix in the cache via the setmean function.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
